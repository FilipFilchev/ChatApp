PSEUDO CODE:
    
    MODULE VisionAssistant:

    IMPORT necessary libraries (like speech recognition, text-to-speech, web browser, etc.)

    INITIALIZE Global constants like WAKE_WORD, CONVERSATION_LOG, SEARCH_WORDS, etc.

    FUNCTION InitializeAssistant:
        - Setup speech recognition
        - Setup text-to-speech engine
        - Maybe initialize other settings like volume, thresholds, etc.

    FUNCTION ListenToUser:
        - Capture audio from the microphone
        - Try to convert the audio to text using a speech recognition service
        - RETURN the converted text

    FUNCTION SpeakToUser(message):
        - Use the text-to-speech engine to say the given message

    FUNCTION LogConversation(message):
        - Add the message to the conversation log with date and time

    FUNCTION HandleOpenCommands(command):
        - Open various applications or websites based on command
        - Speak appropriate response to user

    FUNCTION HandleTimeQueries(command):
        - Respond with current date, time or other date-related information

    FUNCTION HandleMathQueries(command):
        - Parse the command to find operands and operators
        - Perform the math operation
        - Respond with the result

    FUNCTION HandleWeatherQueries(command):
        - Get weather information based on location and command
        - Respond with the weather details

    FUNCTION HandleSearchQueries(command):
        - Open a browser with a search query related to the command

    FUNCTION AnalyzeCommand(command):
        - Identify the type of the command using keywords or patterns
        - Call the appropriate handler function based on the identified type

    FUNCTION MainLoop:
        - Continuously listen for the wake word
        - If wake word is detected, listen for the command
        - Analyze the command and perform the appropriate action
        - Log the conversation
        - Maybe handle exceptions or errors


    CALL MainLoop

OR USE OOP INTEGRATING THE CHAT FUNCTIONALITY INTO A CLASS 
You can execute the response generation inside or outside the main while loop (diff approaches)
